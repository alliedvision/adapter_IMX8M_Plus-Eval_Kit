This repository contains open hardware design files for an adapter board supporting the Allied Vision Alvium CSI-2 camera pinout to i.MX 8M Plus EVK. The board allows the user to interface with two Alvium MIPI CSI-2 compatible cameras over a Flexible Flat Cable (FFC) connector.

You can also purchase the adapter from [Allied Vision](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/accessories/interface-connections/#!?cameraInterfacefilter=10) or from our [distributors](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/avt-locations/avt-distributors/).
